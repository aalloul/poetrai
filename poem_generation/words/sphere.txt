Write a short mysterious poem about sphere without using the word sphere


In realms celestial, a perfect form,
A cosmic wonder, where secrets swarm.
A three-dimensional wonder, round and true,
A shape unbounded, in skies of blue.

A celestial body, complete and whole,
A cosmic ballet, in orbits it rolls.
A seamless curvature, no end in sight,
A symphony of shapes, in perfect light.

In the realm of geometry, a figure revered,
A volume infinite, with dimensions clear.
A boundless shape, in space it resides,
A cosmic entity, where wonder presides.

Oh, this celestial entity, round and grand,
A cosmic marvel, on vast cosmic strands.
In the realm of existence, a shape so pure,
A wondrous creation, ever enduring and sure.
