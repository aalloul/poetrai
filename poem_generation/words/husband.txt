Write a short mysterious poem about husband without using the word husband


In a life entwined, a cherished bond,
A partner true, through moments fond.
With love's embrace, a soul's reprieve,
A companion's presence, in all we believe.

A steadfast heart, by my side each day,
Guiding light, in life's intricate play.
A steady hand, that holds me near,
A sheltering presence, in times of fear.

A pillar of strength, unwavering and strong,
In your embrace, I forever belong.
Through laughter and tears, hand in hand,
Together we walk, a united band.

With tender words, your kindness flows,
A gentle touch, that comforts and knows.
In your eyes, a love that shines bright,
A flame that burns, day and night.
