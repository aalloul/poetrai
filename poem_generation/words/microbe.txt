Write a short mysterious poem about microbes without using the word microbes


In unseen realms, a hidden domain,
Invisible life, a mysterious terrain.
Tiny inhabitants, dwelling unseen,
A shadowy existence, where secrets convene.

In whispered whispers, they silently thrive,
A subtle dance, in every breath, alive.
Invisible forces, they intertwine,
Unveiling mysteries, in the depths they confine.

Within our bodies, a world so vast,
Microscopic dwellers, holding steadfast.
A delicate balance, a covert symphony,
A cosmic ecosystem, where wonders decree.

In shadowed corners, they quietly dwell,
An enigma woven, as stories they tell.
From unseen battles to hidden lore,
Microscopic whispers, forever explore.
