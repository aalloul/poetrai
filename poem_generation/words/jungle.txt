Write a short mysterious poem about jungle without using the word jungle


In lush domain where wild things roam,
Nature's embrace, a sacred home.
Where verdant canopy meets earth below,
Ancient spirits whisper, secrets they bestow.

Amidst emerald hues, life's vibrant symphony,
Nature's melody, in perfect harmony.
Through dappled light, wisdom's path unfurls,
Nature's classroom, where knowledge swirls.

A tapestry woven, in flora's embrace,
Ancestral footprints, we humbly trace.
In vibrant blooms and towering trees,
A sacred dance, where life finds ease.

From river's flow to hidden trails,
Nature's bounty, our humble scales.
Through wind-kissed leaves, whispers arise,
Guiding us, beneath azure skies.
