Write a short mysterious poem about chart without using the word chart

Upon a parchment veiled in cryptic guise,
Lines and symbols, secrets in disguise.
A labyrinth of knowledge, mystic design,
Whispering tales, obscured by time.

In arcane symbols, destinies entwined,
Graphs and pathways, the universe defined.
Mapping the realms of the known and unknown,
A tapestry of insight, meticulously sown.

Silent hieroglyphs, an ancient code,
Concealing wisdom, waiting to be bestowed.
A portal to realms beyond our sight,
Where answers dwell, hidden from light.

Inscribed enigmas, a celestial score,
Guiding seekers to an unseen shore.
Traversing pathways, seeking hidden clues,
Unlocking mysteries, the esoteric muse.
