Write a short mysterious poem about boat without using the word boat

Upon the water's mirrored sheen,
A vessel sails, its purpose keen.
A wooden craft, gliding afar,
Through veils of mist, guided by star.

A floating realm, a vessel's embrace,
Navigating currents, with grace and pace.
Its hull, a cradle for secrets untold,
Whispered tales, mysteries unfold.

Drifting whispers, echoes of the deep,
A silent captain, secrets to keep.
Through moonlit nights and darkened shrouds,
It charts a course, beyond the crowds.

A wanderer's refuge, a seeker's flight,
Across the waves, into the night.
Lost in horizons, where mysteries reside,
This ethereal craft, forever tied.
