Write a short mysterious poem about soda without using the word soda


In a glass, a fizzy delight,
Bubbles swirling, dancing in light.
A sweet elixir, a refreshing sip,
A sparkling potion, on eager lips.

Effervescent joy, in liquid form,
A burst of flavor, vibrant and warm.
A tantalizing treat, for taste buds to explore,
A carbonated bliss, we all adore.

A burst of effervescence, in a glass of cheer,
A bubbly companion, always near.
A delightful potion, in a world of thirst,
A sip of delight, where cravings are dispersed.

Oh, this effervescent nectar, so divine,
A delightful pleasure, that truly shines.
In a symphony of bubbles, a fizzy cascade,
A liquid delight, that never fades.
