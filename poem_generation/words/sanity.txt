Write a short mysterious poem about sanity without using the word sanity


In the realm of reason, a steady mind,
A beacon of clarity, in thoughts refined.
A tranquil state, where chaos subsides,
Balance restored, as the tempest abides.

A harmonious presence, in thoughts aligned,
Serenity's embrace, where peace is assigned.
A stronghold against the tumultuous storm,
A sanctuary within, where tranquility is born.

In the pursuit of wisdom, a grounded stance,
A compass of consciousness, guiding life's dance.
A thread of lucidity, weaving through the mind,
Keeping illusions at bay, truths to unwind.

A fortress of clarity, unclouded and clear,
Where shadows disperse, dispelling fear.
A beacon of light, in the darkest night,
Upholding reason, with unwavering might.
