Write a short mysterious poem about cheating without using the word cheating

In shadows cast by deceit's dark guise,
A dance of falsehood, veiled in guise.
A web of whispers, a clandestine affair,
Where trust is shattered, hearts ensnared.

A masquerade of secrets, hidden in plain sight,
A treacherous game, veiled in the night.
Betrayal's waltz, a silent symphony,
Lies entwined with stolen harmony.

Furtive glances, averted eyes,
A puzzle of deceit, woven with lies.
A path diverged, veering from the true,
A fractured bond, tainted and askew.

Like a mirror cracked, reflections distort,
Love's foundation crumbles, emotions contort.
A path obscured, the truth concealed,
In this enigma of trust, wounds revealed.
