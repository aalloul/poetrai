Write a short mysterious poem about calendar without using the word calendar

In the pages marked by time's decree,
A tapestry woven, the future to see.
A rhythmic dance of days and nights,
Unveiling mysteries, in celestial heights.

A map of moments, an ancient code,
Guiding our steps, as stories unfold.
Glyphs of seasons, etched in rhyme,
A secret language, transcending time.

In numbered cycles, it charts the course,
A compass of fate, with cryptic force.
Days entwined, in a cosmic ballet,
Whispering secrets, as they sway.

Through lunar phases, the months unfold,
A celestial clockwork, forever untold.
The passing of years, like fading ink,
Inscribed on parchment, what does it think?
