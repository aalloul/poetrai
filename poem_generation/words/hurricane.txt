Write a short mysterious poem about hurricane without using the word hurricane


In nature's wrath, a tempest's might,
A furious symphony, unleashed in the night.
Winds howling fierce, a symphony of fear,
Raging forces, devastation drawing near.

Roaring currents, a wild and violent dance,
Unleashing chaos, leaving nothing to chance.
Thrashing waves, crashing upon the shore,
A survivor's tale, forever to endure.

Unyielding power, tearing through the land,
Leaving shattered dreams in its merciless hand.
Roofs torn asunder, trees uprooted with force,
A battle for survival, a harrowing course.

Amid the chaos, unity's embrace,
Neighbors helping neighbors, no trace of disgrace.
Rebuilding lives, brick by brick, we stand,
In the face of adversity, together we expand.
