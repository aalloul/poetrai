Write a short mysterious poem about sleep without using the word sleep


In the realm of dreams, where minds find rest,
We find solace in slumber, an embrace blessed.
With eyes gently closed, we drift away,
To a world unseen, where hearts can sway.

In tranquil realms, where thoughts take flight,
We journey together, in the veiled night.
Wrapped in the warmth of night's tender caress,
We find serenity, a love we confess.

As twilight descends, and stars softly gleam,
Our souls intertwine, like a cherished dream.
In the gentle hush, where whispers reside,
Our hearts find solace, side by side.

Oh, this nocturnal dance, where love is expressed,
In the quiet lullaby of hearts, so deeply impressed.
In the embrace of night, where passions ignite,
We find true bliss, in love's sweetest delight.
