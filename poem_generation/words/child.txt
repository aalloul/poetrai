Write a short mysterious poem about child without using the word child

In innocence's embrace, a tender bloom,
A spirit pure, a room enshrined in gloom.
Curiosity's spark, a flame yet unlit,
Unfolding mysteries, a world to be knit.

A vessel of wonder, untouched and unknown,
Whispers of secrets within their being sown.
A celestial seed, destined to unfurl,
Nurtured by time, a cosmic swirl.

Eyes gleaming with secrets, a radiant glow,
A tapestry of potential, waiting to show.
Cloaked in possibilities, a future untold,
A journey's beginning, a destiny to behold.

From fragile bud to the enigma within,
A mystery unfolding, beneath life's din.
Unveiling the riddles of existence's mold,
A soul's enigmatic tale waiting to be told.
