Write a short mysterious poem about zebra without using the word zebra

In Afric's realm, where grasslands stretch afar,
A creature roams, adorned with stripes that spar.
A beast of beauty, black and white combined,
In nature's brushstroke, a masterpiece defined.

A creature bold, with grace that knows no bounds,
Its patterns grand, like nature's secret grounds.
With gentle stride, it treads the plains so wide,
A symbol of freedom, where wild hearts reside.

Its monochrome attire, a tapestry to behold,
In savannah's realm, where tales untold unfold.
A creature untamed, in harmony with its land,
A living artwork, crafted by nature's hand.

In rhythmic steps, it blends with shadows deep,
A marvel rare, where contrast finds its keep.
By sun's embrace, its coat doth gleam and glow,
A vision true, where elegance doth flow.
