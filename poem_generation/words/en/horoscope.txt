Write a short mysterious poem about horoscope without using the word horoscope


In celestial patterns, stars align,
Cosmic phenomena we aim to define.
A study of celestial configurations,
Mapping influences through observations.

Through data analysis, we discern,
Celestial movements, patterns to learn.
In planetary cycles, we detect,
Influences that might intersect.

Astrological correlations we observe,
As planetary motions steadily curve.
Mapping the heavens, our quest remains,
To decipher celestial influences' domains.

With astronomical precision, we explore,
Cosmic connections at nature's core.
Analyzing celestial phenomena's might,
In search of scientific insight.
