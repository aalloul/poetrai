Write a short mysterious poem about window without using the word window


An open frame, where light doth find its way,
A portal, granting glimpses of the day.
A passage to the world beyond, untamed,
Where sights and sounds in harmony are framed.

A glassy divide, betwixt two realms so near,
Through which the breeze doth whisper, soft and clear.
A herald of nature's beauty and delight,
Revealing vistas, enchanting to the sight.

With gentle latch, it invites both near and far,
A gateway to behold the moon and star.
A canvas painted with each changing scene,
Unveiling stories, as if by magic glean.

Oh, sight's aperture, a treasure untold,
A glimpse into a world of stories bold.
By any other guise, thou art still fair,
A threshold to the wonders that lie there.
