Write a short mysterious poem about appointment without using the word appointment

Marked moment in time, we meet,
A designated space where two hearts greet.
A rendezvous set in a world so fast,
A fleeting pause, where memories are cast.

An agreement honored, a promise made,
To come together in a chosen shade.
A juncture carved amidst life's flow,
Where paths converge, and stories grow.

Time's embrace, a gentle hand,
Guides us to this destined land.
A shared encounter, an interlude,
Where destinies align and spirits elude.

In this scheduled instance, we arrive,
To share our presence, to feel alive.
A chapter written in the book of chance,
A meeting orchestrated by life's dance.
