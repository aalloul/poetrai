Write a short mysterious poem about engine without using the word engine


In the belly of the beast, gears do turn,
A fiery contraption, a lesson to learn.
A metal heart, that roars and purrs,
An unruly creature, with pistons and spurs.

With a mighty grunt, it springs to life,
A mechanical marvel, causing some strife.
It chugs and sputters, with a belch of smoke,
An eccentric contraption, a comical joke.

With bolts and nuts, it's a curious sight,
A tangle of parts, a puzzling delight.
It rattles and shakes, with a noisy hum,
A cacophony of clanks, a symphony of fun.

Its power unleashed, with a humorous glee,
A spirited contraption, full of quirky glee.
It coughs and wheezes, like an old man's snore,
A comical contrivance, leaving us wanting more.
