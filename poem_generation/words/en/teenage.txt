Write a short mysterious poem about teenage without using the word teenage


In shadows veiled, a time emerges,
Betwixt innocence and secrets submerged.
A cloak of transition, whispers unfold,
A realm of enigma, stories untold.

A dance of twilight, where veils descend,
In twilight's haze, mysteries transcend.
A labyrinth of emotions, hidden and deep,
A riddle unsolved, secrets to keep.

Ethereal beings, in search of their way,
Through mists of uncertainty, they sway.
A fleeting enchantment, a puzzle untied,
In the enigmatic realm, where whispers reside.

Oh, this clandestine passage, where shadows play,
A realm of intrigue, in twilight's gray.
In the mystic hour of youth, secrets unfurl,
In the enigmatic realm, where mysteries swirl.
