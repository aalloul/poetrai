Write a short mysterious poem about screen without using the word screen


In the realm of pixels, where images reside,
A window to the world, where visions collide.
A canvas of light, where stories unfold,
A gateway to realms, both new and old.

A frame of glass, reflecting thoughts and dreams,
A portal to possibilities, it truly seems.
A visual vessel, where colors dance and gleam,
Unveiling wonders, like a magical stream.

Through this looking glass, connections are made,
A bridge between hearts, where emotions cascade.
A gateway to knowledge, a boundless expanse,
A gateway to cultures, in a digital dance.

Oh, this realm of visual delight,
Where narratives unfold, both day and night.
In this ethereal realm, where images convene,
A world unseen, but vividly seen.
