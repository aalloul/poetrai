Write a short mysterious poem about wheel without using the word wheel


Upon the stage of life, a wondrous sight,
A circled frame, poised in motion's flight.
With wooden spoke and axle's gentle sway,
It bears the weight, as fortunes ebb and play.

A merry dancer, turning in delight,
A marvel born of craftsman's skillful plight.
In circles spinning, constant and true,
It carries burdens, old and new.

This circled wonder, by horses yoked,
Or with human hands, its path is poked.
It journeys far, o'er rough and meek terrain,
A tireless servant, loyal and fain.

Through weary miles, it rolls and turns,
As travelers ride, and cities it discerns.
A bearer of progress, through ages told,
Its silent revolution, a tale unfold.
