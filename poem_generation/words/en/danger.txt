Write a short mysterious poem about danger without using the word danger


In the realm where shadows creep and sway,
A silent force, luring astray.
A phantom's whisper, a chilling touch,
A cryptic path, beckoning much.

A flicker in the dark, a warning unseen,
A treacherous allure, deceivingly serene.
A dance with the unknown, adrenaline's call,
A cloak of mystery, enticing all.

Eyes gleaming with secrets, a silent cue,
A labyrinth of hazards, dangers accrue.
A precipice unseen, a precipitous leap,
In the depths of uncertainty, secrets keep.

Whispers on the wind, caution's plea,
An enigmatic force, cloaked in mystery.
A clandestine presence, waiting in the night,
A thrilling enigma, shrouded from sight.
