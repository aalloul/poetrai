Write a short mysterious poem about bank without using the word bank

A fortress of wealth, where coins reside,
Where fortunes grow, on this financial tide.
A vault of prosperity, where transactions flow,
A guardian of treasures, that many will know.

A haven for currencies, a shelter secure,
Where savings are kept, a promise to endure.
A gateway to funds, a key to finance,
A pillar of stability, a realm to enhance.

Within its walls, transactions are made,
A hub of commerce, where debts are paid.
Numbers and digits dance in digital array,
Economic currents guiding the way.

A beacon of trust, where dreams find support,
Loans and investments, a chance to exhort.
A symbol of commerce, a heartbeat of trade,
A cornerstone of growth, foundations laid.
