Write a short mysterious poem about jeans without using the word jeans


In the dusty plains where cowboys roam,
A trusty garment, a part of home.
Blue denim armor, sturdy and true,
A cowboy's companion, for work they do.

A second skin, fit just right,
Ready for the rodeo, dawn 'til night.
Tough as leather, yet soft to wear,
A rugged charm, beyond compare.

With faded patches, like stories untold,
Each tear and rip, a journey bold.
A cowboy's pride, in every thread,
A testament to life, where legends spread.

Through brush and thorn, they endure,
From sunrise to sunset, steadfast and pure.
A cowboy's uniform, as wild as the West,
In denim's embrace, they're truly blessed.
