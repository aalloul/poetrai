Write a short mysterious poem about craddle without using the word craddle


In the nest of dreams, where slumber thrives,
A vessel of serenity, where innocence arrives.
A haven of whispers, gentle and deep,
A cocoon of mystery, where secrets keep.

A sacred vessel, in tender embrace,
Cradling precious souls with ethereal grace.
A sanctuary of silence, a nocturnal shrine,
Where whispers of destiny intertwine.

Within its confines, a fragile cocoon,
A portal to realms beyond the moon.
A gateway to wonder, where stars align,
Nurturing dreams, a celestial sign.

Wrapped in warmth, a cradle of night,
Guarded by shadows, concealed from sight.
A refuge of mystery, a treasure's nest,
Where possibilities bloom, yet unguessed.
