Write a short mysterious poem about diamond without using the word diamond


Within Earth's deepest vault, a crystal's embrace,
A gleaming treasure, adorning nature's grace.
A radiant shard, born from secrets concealed,
A jewel of mysteries, the earth's treasure revealed.

A prism of light, captivating the eye,
An enigmatic essence, sparkling in the sky.
A fragment of stardust, forged in cosmic fire,
A celestial enigma, whispered by the universe's lyre.

A glimmering enigma, a treasure untold,
Veiled in brilliance, mysteries unfold.
A symbol of endurance, forged in pressure's reign,
A precious whisper, hidden in its refracted chain.

Captivating allure, an ethereal delight,
A gift from depths unknown, crafted in the night.
A puzzle of clarity, secrets veiled within,
A cosmic enigma, where wonderings begin.
