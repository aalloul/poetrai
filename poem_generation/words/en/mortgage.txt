Write a short mysterious poem about mortgage without using the word mortgage


In shadowed depths, a contract binds,
A clandestine agreement, where secrecy finds.
A pact of debts, a web entwined,
A cryptic dance, where destinies aligned.

In whispered whispers, echoes conceal,
A haunting burden, secrets to reveal.
Numbers and figures, shrouded in haze,
A mysterious path, where fortunes graze.

Within these walls, a borrower's plight,
A weighty arrangement, hidden from sight.
A labyrinth of payments, in darkness entwined,
A puzzle unsolved, secrets confined.

From the depths of finance, a binding spell,
A mystical bond, where fortunes dwell.
A journey veiled, with consequences unknown,
A financial enigma, silently grown.
