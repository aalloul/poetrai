Write a short mysterious poem about water without using the word water


Upon this mortal realm, a liquid's grace,
A fluid essence, meandering in pace.
Through verdant valleys and o'er rocky dale,
It doth embark, a journey without fail.

Like tears of heaven, it doth descend,
From azure heights, its course to lend.
In babbling brooks and gentle streams,
Its gentle touch, a poet's dream.

In chaliced blooms, it finds repose,
Caressing petals, like lover's prose.
A life's elixir, pure and serene,
Reviving earth, in hues of green.

The mighty rivers, they doth flow,
Through timeless lands, with ceaseless show.
Their currents strong, in torrential might,
Carving canyons, a wondrous sight.
