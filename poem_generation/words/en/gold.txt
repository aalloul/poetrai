Write a short mysterious poem about gold without using the word gold


In realms of brilliance, where sunlight gleams,
A treasure divine, of radiant beams.
A gleaming metal, a shimmering light,
A gift from the earth, shining so bright.

From earth's embrace, a noble prize,
A glittering essence, that never dies.
A precious bounty, with captivating sheen,
A symbol of wealth, throughout the scene.

Its lustrous glow, a beacon of might,
A treasure sought, by day and by night.
From ancient tales to modern lore,
Its allure captivates, forevermore.

With alchemical prowess, it's shaped and refined,
Crafted into beauty, an art so refined.
Adorning kings and queens, with regal grace,
A mark of stature, in every embrace.
