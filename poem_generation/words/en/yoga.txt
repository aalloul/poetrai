Write a short mysterious poem about yoga without using the word yoga


In tranquil stillness, a body's gentle sway,
A dance of grace, as limbs find their own way.
A mindful art, where breath and movement meld,
A path to balance, where souls are compelled.

In poses held, like statues carved in stone,
A harmony achieved, body and mind in zone.
Each stretch and bend, a quest for inner peace,
A unity sought, where tensions find release.

A gentle flow, like rivers winding free,
Connecting realms of body, spirit, and sea.
With focus keen, each posture finds its home,
In sacred spaces where energy's free to roam.

Through mindful breaths, the soul finds solace deep,
As thoughts unravel, and worries gently sleep.
In meditation's realm, a sanctuary pure,
The essence of serenity, tranquil and secure.
