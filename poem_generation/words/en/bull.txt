Write a short mysterious poem about bull without using the word bull

In the field, a force takes form,
A creature fierce, a primal storm.
Hooves that pound, earth trembles beneath,
A gaze of fire, a spirit unleashed.

Muscles rippling, power untamed,
In shadows cast, a mystery claimed.
A guardian of the untamed lands,
Where legends dwell, in shifting sands.

Horns that curve, an ancient crown,
An aura of strength, renowned.
A tempest's wrath, a thunderous might,
Eyes that pierce, in the darkest night.

A symbol of vigor, both fierce and bold,
In tales of old, its stories unfold.
In legends whispered, secrets held tight,
A creature of wonder, in mystical light.
