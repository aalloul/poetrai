Write a short mysterious poem about supermarket without using the word supermarket


In the realm of aisles, where abundance blooms,
A haven of choices, a shopper's heirlooms.
A gathering of goods, in vibrant display,
A treasure trove of options, in every way.

Shelves filled with bounty, a cornucopia of fare,
A place of convenience, where needs are met with care.
A bustling hub, where commerce finds its flow,
A labyrinth of possibilities, where desires grow.

Shopping carts glide, down lanes so wide,
A maze of aisles, where wishes coincide.
A haven for provisions, where lists are checked,
A sanctuary of sustenance, where cravings are fetched.

Oh, this emporium of essentials, where desires take flight,
A haven for shoppers, in a world of delight.
In the realm of supply, where variety is grand,
A marketplace of choices, where shopping is grand.
