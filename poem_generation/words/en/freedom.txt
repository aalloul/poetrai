Write a short mysterious poem about freedom without using the word freedom


In a land where rules are lax,
There's a dance called the "No-tax"!
No boundaries to confine,
Where laughter and joy intertwine.

No alarm clocks, just sleep in,
No work, just play, let the fun begin!
No limits on pizza, eat all you please,
No calories, it's pure comedy!

No dress code, wear pajamas all day,
No traffic, just hover and sway.
No bills to pay, it's a financial treat,
No taxes, your pockets stay complete!

No curfews, stay out all night,
No worries, everything's alright.
No diets, indulge in every feast,
No weight gain, a comical release!
