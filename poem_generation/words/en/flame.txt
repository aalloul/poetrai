Write a short mysterious poem about flame without using the word flame


Within the darkness, a glowing light,
A dance of warmth, illuminating the night.
A flickering spirit, dancing with might,
In radiant hues, it paints its delight.

A fiery presence, untamed and bold,
A source of energy, fierce and untold.
A mesmerizing display, vibrant and bright,
It dances and sways, igniting the sight.

With a passionate touch, it ignites the soul,
A symbol of passion, beyond control.
A gentle warmth, or a raging fire,
An element of power, that won't tire.

In its embrace, shadows retreat,
Its brilliance shines, casting a heat.
A mystical force, mysterious and wild,
A captivating essence, that forever beguiles.
