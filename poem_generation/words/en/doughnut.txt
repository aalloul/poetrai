Write a short mysterious poem about doughnut without using the word doughnut


In a ring of sweetness, a portal unveiled,
A mystic creation, where secrets are veiled.
A circular enigma, indulgence profound,
Whispers of delight in every bite found.

Within its curves, a journey unfolds,
Layers of mystique, a story untold.
An edible halo, with flavors unseen,
A tantalizing puzzle, enticingly keen.

A portal to pleasure, in golden embrace,
A glimpse of nirvana, a moment's chase.
A confectionary riddle, sugared delight,
An enigmatic temptation, lingering in sight.

From frying pan's alchemy, its magic derives,
A clandestine process, where wonder survives.
In every crumb, a mystery untold,
A bite-sized enigma, in sugar's stronghold.
