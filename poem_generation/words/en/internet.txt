Write a short mysterious poem about internet without using the word internet


In a vast realm of endless bytes,
Where knowledge flows and sparks ignite.
A digital expanse, connections grand,
A network binding minds, across the land.

A web of wonders, where worlds collide,
Information's highway, a thrilling ride.
With clicks and scrolls, we navigate,
Through virtual realms, we innovate.

Through cables and signals, data streams,
A digital symphony, in countless themes.
Bytes and bits, dancing in the air,
Transmitting thoughts with utmost care.

From servers humming, data stored,
A virtual treasure trove, widely adored.
Emails, chats, and forums alive,
A digital community, where geeks thrive.
