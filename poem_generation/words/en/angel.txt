Write a short mysterious poem about angel without using the word angel

In realms ethereal, grace takes flight,
A celestial being, clothed in light.
Messenger of hope, a radiant guide,
With wings that shimmer, heaven's pride.

A presence pure, from realms unknown,
A harbinger of love, where seeds are sown.
A gentle touch, a soothing balm,
Guardian of souls, in calm and storm.

With golden halo, a glowing crown,
A spirit pure, in love profound.
A celestial being, divine embrace,
A symbol of solace, adorned with grace.

Sent from realms beyond our sight,
A bearer of mercy, a guiding light.
A celestial being, embodiment of care,
Whispering peace in silent prayer.
