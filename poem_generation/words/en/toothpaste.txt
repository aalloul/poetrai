Write a short mysterious poem about toothpaste without using the word toothpaste


From slender tube, secrets emerge,
Substance of gleaming, whispered surge.
Opaque vessel, its mysteries kept,
A substance mysterious, in silence adept.

A minty whisper, a touch of white,
Enigmatic paste, a dental delight.
With every squeeze, a secret unfolds,
Unveiling freshness, as tales are told.

In gentle strokes, it glides and graces,
A clandestine agent, leaving no traces.
An enigma's kiss, it coats each tooth,
Concealing secrets, profound and uncouth.

Opaque veil, a subtle allure,
In its embrace, secrets endure.
A frosted secret, a mystic gel,
Whispering mysteries it won't foretell.
