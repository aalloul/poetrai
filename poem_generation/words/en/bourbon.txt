Write a short mysterious poem about bourbon without using the word bourbon

Within the amber depths, a spirit's embrace,
An elixir aged, veiled in time and space.
From the charred embrace of the ancient oak,
A mystic potion, whispers of smoke.

In depths of amber, secrets reside,
A liquid fire, where mysteries hide.
A symphony of flavors, an alchemist's blend,
Unveiling tales, with each sip, transcend.

Aged in barrels, where history's kept,
Whispering tales, from the cellar's depth.
Hints of warmth, a touch of spice,
An enigmatic elixir, tempting vice.

From golden hue to notes unseen,
An elixir cherished, a taste pristine.
In sips and whispers, a journey unfurls,
Unveiling secrets, that this potion hurls.
