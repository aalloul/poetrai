Write a short mysterious poem about kiss without using the word kiss


In a moment's embrace, lips entwined,
A stolen exchange, a sweetness defined.
A tantalizing touch, like secrets unfurled,
A breathless connection, igniting the world.

Two souls colliding, in passion's sway,
A delicate dance, in a captivating display.
The meeting of lips, in an intimate play,
A language unspoken, yet hearts convey.

The whisper of desire, in a gentle graze,
A fiery spark, igniting a blaze.
A silent invitation, the heart's tender plea,
To taste the ecstasy of intimacy.

In a stolen moment, time stands still,
The world around us, a blissful thrill.
A magnetic pull, drawing us near,
As hearts unite, in passion's frontier.
