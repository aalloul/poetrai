Write a short mysterious poem about picture without using the word picture


Through frozen moments, memories reside,
A captured glimpse of life's fleeting tide.
Colors and shapes, a visual tale,
Where time stands still, in its silent veil.

An image preserved, in time's embrace,
A window to the past, a cherished space.
A canvas of emotions, painted with light,
Unveiling stories, both bold and slight.

With frames and snapshots, the world unfolds,
In vivid details, a story it holds.
A visual artifact, an artifact of truth,
A portal to memories, both aged and youth.

In pixels or prints, a visual trace,
An echo of moments, frozen in grace.
A captured essence, in light's embrace,
A treasure of memories, a timeless embrace.
