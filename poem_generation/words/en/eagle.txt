Write a short mysterious poem about eagle without using the word eagle


In boundless skies, a regal sight,
Wings outstretched, an embodiment of flight.
A creature of heights, where heavens blend,
A symbol of freedom, where mysteries transcend.

With eyes that pierce, piercing and keen,
Navigating currents, invisible streams.
A creature of power, feathers of might,
A predator's grace, concealed in flight.

In lofty realms, secrets unfurl,
Silent whispers of a predatory world.
A phantom hunter, elusive and sly,
A guardian of mysteries, soaring on high.

A symbol of vision, of lofty goals,
An enigmatic presence, where wonder unfolds.
A creature of awe, nature's grand design,
A riddle of flight, a mystery divine.
