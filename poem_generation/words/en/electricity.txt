Write a short mysterious poem about electricity without using the word electricity


Invisible sparks, a dance of light,
Unseen currents, mysteries ignite.
A force unleashed, electrifying the air,
A clandestine energy, beyond compare.

A crackling hum, vibrations unknown,
Power surges through wires, secrets to be shown.
An enigmatic presence, charging the night,
Unveiling wonders, in electrified flight.

Invisible tendrils, weaving through space,
A pulsating energy, an enigma's embrace.
A symphony of electrons, buzzing and alive,
An electric enigma, where energies thrive.

From flickering flames to circuits unseen,
A hidden power, in realms between.
A conduit of mystery, secrets it conceals,
A spark of wonder, where fascination reveals.
