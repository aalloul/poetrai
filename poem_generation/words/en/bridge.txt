Write a short mysterious poem about bridge without using the word bridge

In the space where worlds converge,
A connection spans the unknown verge.
A path unseen, suspended in air,
Linking realms, where mysteries ensnare.

A crossing held by unseen hands,
Guiding footsteps to distant lands.
A threshold veiled, secrets to unveil,
Whispers echo, in the hidden trail.

Between the chasms, a silent span,
Where shadows dance, and fates began.
A gateway guarded by veils of mist,
Inviting wanderers, the curious and tryst.

Onward it stretches, an ethereal thread,
A passage between what was and what's ahead.
With every step, the unknown awaits,
A realm uncharted, where secrets consecrate.
