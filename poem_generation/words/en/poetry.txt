Write a short mysterious poem about poetry without using the word poetry


In ink's embrace, thoughts unfurl,
Words dance upon the page, a lyrical swirl.
Verses crafted, emotions unfettered,
A tapestry of language, where hearts are tethered.

Lines cascade, like rivers of thought,
Expressions woven, with meaning sought.
A rhythmic flow, in harmonious flight,
A symphony of words, painted in light.

Imagery blooming, like flowers in spring,
Painting landscapes of the mind, a vivid thing.
Emotions entwined, in phrases profound,
A tapestry of voices, in silence resound.

Whispers of truth, in each chosen phrase,
A glimpse of life's mysteries, a luminous haze.
Through language's embrace, stories are told,
In the boundless realm, where wonders unfold.
