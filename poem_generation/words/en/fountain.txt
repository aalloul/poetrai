Write a short mysterious poem about fountain without using the word fountain


In a magical land, where dreams take flight,
A wondrous cascade, with waters so bright.
From depths unknown, a liquid's embrace,
A shimmering spectacle, a mystical chase.

A secret spring, from earth's core it springs,
An enchanted stream, where magic sings.
Its waters dance, in a playful display,
Glistening and sparkling, along its way.

With a gentle murmur, it tells a tale,
Of ancient wonders, hidden in its trail.
A source of life, that forever flows,
Nourishing dreams wherever it goes.

Its droplets gleam, like precious gems,
Reflecting the moonlight, with radiant stems.
Whispers of wishes, in each tiny splash,
Granting hopes and dreams with a gentle flash.
