Write a short mysterious poem about fire without using the word fire


Yo, flames be burnin', straight up hot,
Spittin' heat like a fiery shot.
Blazin' through the night, wild and untamed,
Leavin' trails of heat, ain't nothin' the sam

Flickerin' lights, like a neon blaze,
Rappin' so fierce, set the crowd ablaze.
Burnin' up the mic, lyrical inferno,
Leavin' heads smokin', no need for a burno.

Flamin' words, spittin' like a dragon's breath,
Leavin' mics melted, no need for a ref.
I'm the arsonist, lightin' up the track,
Leavin' ashes behind, ain't no lookin' back.

In the rap game, I bring the heat,
Call me the arsonist, straight elite.
Got that fiery flow, nothin' can tame,
Burnin' down stages, leavin' marks in my name.
