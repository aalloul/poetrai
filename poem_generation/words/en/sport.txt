Write a short mysterious poem about sport without using the word sport


In the realm of play, where competition thrives,
Bodies in motion, as passion survives.
A field of action, where teams collide,
An arena of skill, where champions abide.

A test of prowess, where athletes soar,
A battle of wills, seeking victory's door.
Muscles in motion, with grace and might,
A display of strength, in the thrill of the fight.

The pursuit of greatness, where records are set,
A symphony of movement, a captivating duet.
An embodiment of dedication and drive,
A celebration of talent, as passions revive.

Oh, this arena of motion, where dreams take flight,
A canvas of energy, in moments so bright.
In the realm of competition, where hearts ignite,
The essence of challenge, in this spirited rite.
