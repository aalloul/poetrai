Write a short mysterious poem about gravity without using the word gravity


In nature's realm, a force divine,
Where objects fall in perfect line.
A subtle power, unseen but felt,
Intricately woven, in ways we're dealt.

With gentle tug, it keeps us bound,
To earthly soils, firmly on the ground.
A universal dance, in celestial sway,
Directing motions, night and day.

Like Newton's muse, with secrets untold,
It governs the cosmos, a tale of old.
Objects descend with measured grace,
Intriguing minds in this timeless chase.

No feathered touch or soaring flight,
Can escape its grip, from day to night.
It binds the stars, with cosmic might,
In heavenly bodies, it orchestrates flight.
