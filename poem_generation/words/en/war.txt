Write a short mysterious poem about war without using the word war

Amidst the storm, brave hearts collide,
Where thunder roars and souls confide.
A clash of forces, fierce and loud,
In battlefields where dreams are shroud.

Armor gleams, reflecting moonlit skies,
As anguish paints the fallen's eyes.
A symphony of echoes, swords in flight,
Unspoken tales of strength and plight.

Beneath the flags, emotions ignite,
The yearning for peace, a distant light.
Yet warriors fight with valor and might,
In shadows cast by a relentless night.

Oh, ceaseless struggle, a tragic refrain,
Where scars run deep, in hearts and veins.
But let us strive for a world anew,
Where swords find rest, and love breaks through.
