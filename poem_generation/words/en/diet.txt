Write a short mysterious poem about diet without using the word diet


Within choices made, a silent pact,
An enigmatic path, a pact intact.
Whispers of nourishment, shadows of need,
A dance of sustenance, the body's creed.

The alchemy of sustenance, a secret's hold,
Fuel for existence, a tale yet untold.
Hidden balance, the body's riddle,
A veiled enigma, a mystery to kindle.

In cravings' sway, desires arise,
A puzzle of nourishment, veiled in disguise.
An intricate maze, where flavors entwine,
Unraveling the enigma, a culinary shrine.

Whispers of sustenance, echoes untold,
Feeding the vessel, stories unfold.
A journey of nourishment, a silent guide,
An enigmatic dance, where secrets reside.
