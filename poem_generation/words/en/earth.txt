Write a short mysterious poem about earth without using the word earth


In nature's embrace, a cradle sublime,
A celestial home, where secrets entwine.
A sphere of wonder, in cosmic array,
A place of existence, where mysteries play.

Beneath celestial arches, nature's realm,
A tapestry of life, an enigma's helm.
A mosaic of landscapes, where wonders reside,
An enigmatic jewel, where secrets abide.

Whispers of life, in flora and beast,
An intricate dance, nature's mysterious feast.
From depths of oceans to peaks high above,
A realm of marvels, where mysteries evolve.

An orb of enchantment, a cosmic stage,
Unveiling the enigmatic with each passing age.
A cradle of stories, in whispers untold,
A celestial enigma, a wonder to behold.
