Write a short mysterious poem about grandfather without using the word grandfather


In wisdom's embrace, a figure stands,
With years aplenty, like shifting sands.
A gentle soul, with stories untold,
A guiding presence, wise and bold.

With silvered hair and weathered face,
A guardian of love, in life's vast space.
A steady hand, with a warm embrace,
A beacon of strength, in every chase.

A wellspring of knowledge, a seasoned guide,
In life's journey, by our side.
With eyes that twinkle, filled with pride,
A pillar of support, our hearts confide.

Through gentle whispers, wisdom is shared,
Lessons of life, in memories ensnared.
With every smile and laughter's burst,
A treasure trove of love, forever immersed.
