Write a short mysterious poem about jupyter without using the word jupyter


In the cosmic realm where planets reside,
A celestial wanderer, in orbits wide.
A gas giant of immense allure,
With swirling storms, a sight pure.

Its banded features, a mesmerizing sight,
Revealing secrets, in depths of the night.
An immense presence, captivating and grand,
A celestial marvel, in the vast expanse.

With moons as companions, in their dance,
Jovian satellites, in celestial trance.
Gravity's grasp, a powerful hold,
Shaping moons and rings, in stories untold.

A behemoth of gas, with mysteries profound,
Astronomers' intrigue, forever unbound.
Through telescopic lens, we peer afar,
Exploring Jupiter, like a distant star.
