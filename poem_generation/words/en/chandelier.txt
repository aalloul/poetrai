Write a short mysterious poem about chandelier without using the word chandelier

Amidst the lofty hall's grand embrace,
A radiant jewel, suspended in space.
A tapestry of light, enchanting the night,
Casting its glow, a celestial delight.

Dangling from shadows, a spectral dance,
Invisible threads, a mystical trance.
A secret bearer of whispers untold,
Veiled in mystery, its story unfolds.

Reflecting secrets in its crystal core,
Intricate patterns, legends it bore.
A guardian of secrets, a silent sentry,
Unveiling whispers from realms aplenty.

A constellation ablaze, shimmering bright,
Guiding lost souls through the darkest night.
An enigmatic beacon, concealed above,
An ethereal symbol, of long-lost love.
