Write a short mysterious poem about labrador without using the word labrador


In nature's realm, a loyal breed,
With joyful spirit, a friend indeed.
A companion true, in every way,
By your side, come what may.

Coat of warmth, a golden hue,
Eyes so kind, they see right through.
Bounding steps, full of zest,
A playful soul, always blessed.

With wagging tail, a cheerful greet,
A loving heart, so pure and sweet.
Unconditional love, forever true,
In your presence, skies turn blue.

In nature's canvas, you roam free,
In forests wide, where wonders be.
A faithful friend, with every stride,
By our side, you're our pride.
