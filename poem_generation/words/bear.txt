Write a short mysterious poem about bear without using the word bear

In the woods, a creature grand,
With fur and claws, a mighty stand.
A forest dweller, strong and true,
Roaming wild, in shades of brown and blue.

A guardian of the wilderness vast,
A symbol of strength from ages past.
With paws that tread the earth with might,
A creature born of ancient light.

Amongst the trees, it claims its reign,
A majestic ruler, free from chain.
A silhouette against the moonlit sky,
A presence wild, that catches the eye.

From hibernation's peaceful sleep,
To rivers deep and mountains steep,
It roams the land with noble grace,
A creature of the wild, with nature's trace.
