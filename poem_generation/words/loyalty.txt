Write a short mysterious poem about loyalty without using the word loyalty


In the realm of trust, a steadfast vow,
A bond unbroken, through here and now.
Through trials faced, and battles fought,
A devotion deep, as time is sought.

Like an unwavering compass, true and sure,
A guiding light, forever secure.
In storms of life, when skies turn gray,
A steadfast presence, to light the way.

Through thick and thin, we walk the path,
Hand in hand, defying life's wrath.
A companion true, through highs and lows,
A love that deepens, and only grows.

In times of need, you stand beside,
A comforting presence, a soul to confide.
In laughter and tears, we share our days,
A connection unspoken, in myriad ways.
