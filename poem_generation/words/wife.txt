Write a short mysterious poem about wife without using the word wife


Fair companion of my heart's delight,
The cherished half that maketh life so bright.
In sacred union, bound by love's sweet vow,
A soul's confidant, my truest thou.

She with grace, that doth my burdens bear,
A partner true, through joy and despair.
A guiding star, in life's uncertain haze,
Her presence kindles hope's eternal blaze.

Her gentle touch, a balm to heal my soul,
Her wisdom, like a beacon, makes me whole.
A steadfast ally, in this mortal strife,
A faithful partner, throughout this life.

Her laughter, like a melody divine,
In her embrace, true solace I find.
A confidante, to share life's every morn,
A bond unbroken, from our love reborn.
