Write a short mysterious poem about kindness without using the word kindness


n tender acts, a gentle touch,
A beacon of light, to hearts it clutch.
Compassionate gestures, a soothing balm,
A world embraced, in words and calm.

A caring soul, in actions pure,
A guiding hand, to help endure.
A selfless gift, in times of need,
A silent language, where hearts can read.

Through empathy's grace, connections ignite,
A spark of warmth, in darkest night.
A ripple effect, spreading far and wide,
Where love's essence, cannot be denied.

In tender whispers, understanding blooms,
A refuge found, in compassion's rooms.
A ray of hope, in someone's despair,
A simple act, showing others we care.
