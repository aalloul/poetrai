Write a short mysterious poem about bitcoin without using the word bitcoin

In shadows deep, a cipher lies,
A digital enigma, veiled in disguise.
Whispers of wealth in hidden code,
A cryptic treasure, waiting to unfold.

Numbers dance in a virtual abyss,
A clandestine currency, shrouded in mist.
Decentralized whispers, secrets untold,
Unmasking the mysteries, yet to behold.

Through networks vast, it travels unseen,
A phantom of value, an elusive dream.
Anonymous transactions, identities masked,
A cryptographic puzzle, daringly tasked.

From the depths of code, a revolution stirs,
A metamorphosis of finance, as it occurs.
Emerging from darkness, with promises grand,
A new era dawns, guided by its command.
