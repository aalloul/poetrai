Write a short mysterious poem about blinds without using the word blinds

Behind the veil, shadows reside,
Concealing secrets that quietly hide.
A barrier of mystery, obscuring sight,
Hiding whispers of the hidden light.

Obscuring windows, an enigmatic screen,
A shield against prying eyes, unseen.
Cloaked in veils, secrets take flight,
Unveiling truths, in the cover of night.

A barrier of fabric, a clandestine guise,
A portal to realms where secrets arise.
Concealing glimpses, a puzzle untold,
A realm between worlds, where mysteries unfold.

Behind the curtain, worlds collide,
In the realm of secrets, veiled with pride.
A dance of shadows, a story untold,
Where truth and illusion intricately mold.
