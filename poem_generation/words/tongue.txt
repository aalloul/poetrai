Write a short mysterious poem about tongue without using the word tongue


Silent harbinger of secrets veiled,
Unfathomable, yet seldom unveiled.
Crafts the whispers, a vessel unseen,
Conveying tales where truths convene.

Wielder of words, a mystic gate,
Held captive behind a fateful fate.
Curved and nimble, the enigma's key,
Unraveling secrets that long to be free.

Enchanting symphony, melodies born,
Of unspoken verses, a symposium torn.
With clandestine power, it weaves and wefts,
An enigmatic force, in depths it's left.

In shadows lingering, murmurs reside,
A riddle unsolved, concealed by pride.
Seek not the surface, a mirage so grand,
Embrace the mystery, the hidden demand.
