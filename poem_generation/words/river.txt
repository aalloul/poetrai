Write a short mysterious poem about river without using the word river


In nature's embrace, a flowing path,
A ribbon of life, where secrets amass.
A winding journey, from source to sea,
A current's dance, forever free.

Through valleys and meadows, it finds its way,
Carving landscapes, both night and day.
A liquid pulse, with relentless might,
Nourishing earth, in its watery flight.

Like veins of the land, it sustains and feeds,
A lifeline of ecosystems, where life proceeds.
Reflecting sunlight, with a shimmering hue,
A mirror of skies, both vibrant and blue.

In its depths, stories untold,
Whispered tales, from times of old.
A passage of time, in its steady flow,
Witness to histories, that come and go.
