Write a short mysterious poem about stomach without using the word stomach


In the core of being, where hunger resides,
A chamber of cravings, where appetite hides.
A vessel of nourishment, a container of need,
A center of sustenance, a vital feed.

A cavern of yearning, where digestion begins,
A home of hunger, where satisfaction wins.
A realm of sustenance, where hunger's met,
A place of nourishment, where satiety is set.

In the depths of the body, where cravings entwine,
A sanctuary of sustenance, where flavors align.
A place of nourishment, where hunger is fed,
A sanctuary of sustenance, where cravings are spread.

Oh, this internal sanctuary, where hunger awakes,
A space of nourishment, where fulfillment takes.
In the depths of our being, where hunger resides,
The core of our sustenance, where satisfaction abides.
