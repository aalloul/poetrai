Write a short mysterious poem about snow without using the word snow


In nature's grasp, a frozen embrace,
A world transformed, in icy lace.
The air, a shiver in every breath,
A frosty touch, that chills to the depths.

Whispers of winter, in the crisp air,
A frigid veil, that leaves none unaware.
A silent dance, of icy crystals descending,
A chill that lingers, with each step, impending.

Nature's hand, in a wintry display,
A palette of white, where colors fray.
A biting cold, that numbs the skin,
A frozen kingdom, where winter begins.

In this realm of ice, where warmth is rare,
A frozen silence, that hangs in the air.
A wintery spell, that seeps through the bone,
A reminder of cold's relentless tone.
