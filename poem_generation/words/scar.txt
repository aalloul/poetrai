Write a short mysterious poem about scar without using the word scar


Upon the canvas of skin, a tale untold,
A mark that whispers stories, stories bold.
A map of battles fought, both deep and near,
A testament of resilience, without a fear.

A line etched in time, where wounds once bled,
A reminder of strength, where healing spread.
A history engraved, with memories held tight,
A symbol of survival, a beacon of light.

In the tapestry of flesh, a lasting trace,
A sign of transformation, a newfound grace.
A testament to the body's remarkable art,
Where brokenness finds solace, a brand-new start.

Oh, this mark, a testament to the past,
A symbol of courage, a memory that will last.
In the symphony of life, where marks are born,
A reminder of endurance, where strength is sworn.
