Write a short mysterious poem about coal without using the word coal

Within the Earth's embrace, darkness unfolds,
A treasure buried deep, a story yet untold.
A relic of fire, forged by ancient hands,
A veiled enigma, concealed in darkened lands.

A blackened gem, born of nature's design,
Concealing secrets in layers entwined.
A fossilized riddle, silent and profound,
Whispering tales from depths profound.

A charred embrace, an enigmatic shroud,
Residue of forgotten fires, veiled in cloud.
A fuel for flames, with mysteries concealed,
An embodiment of time, forever sealed.

Beneath the sooty veil, whispers resonate,
An echo of ages, a journey innate.
From ancient forests to darkness imbued,
A cosmic dance, where secrets accrue.
