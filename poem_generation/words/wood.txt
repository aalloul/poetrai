Write a short mysterious poem about wood without using the word wood


From nature's realm, a substance firm and true,
Born of the forest, in nature's grand debut.
A sturdy form, from towering giants hewn,
A foundation strong, by craftsmen's hands, imbued.

Its fibers woven in a tapestry rare,
A testament to strength beyond compare.
From ancient roots, it bears a timeless tale,
A silent witness to stories it can share.

In hearth and home, it finds its rightful place,
A shelter's embrace, a haven's embrace.
A fortress built, a sanctuary true,
Where warmth and comfort interlace.

From cradle to crib, a vessel to bestow,
A crafted toy, a child's heart aglow.
A legacy of craftsmanship's embrace,
A timeless artistry, forever to show.
