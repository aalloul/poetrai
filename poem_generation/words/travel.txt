Write a short mysterious poem about travel without using the word travel


Beyond the known, a realm untamed,
Journey embarked, a soul unclaimed.
Wandering paths, where whispers hide,
Through veils unseen, destinies glide.

Footprints lost in shifting sands,
Seeker of realms, with eager hands.
In distant lands, where mysteries reside,
Adventures woven, secrets confide.

A compass spins, a guiding light,
Leading through darkness, a traveler's plight.
In hidden corners, treasures await,
Unveiling wonders, where time abates.

Through winding alleys, shadows creep,
Seeking solace in secrets deep.
Across horizons, on wings unseen,
Whispering winds, the voyage convenes.
