Write a short mysterious poem about printer without using the word printer


Behold, a vessel of creation's might,
A conduit of thoughts, casting light.
Ink flows like sacred rivers divine,
Transcribing visions, on pages they align.

Through divine mechanism, messages unfold,
Words become scripture, stories untold.
A holy conduit, in service profound,
A channel for wisdom, to all around.

In whispers of letters, prayers take flight,
Manifesting visions, in the ink's gentle plight.
Like a scribe's devotion, with pen and quill,
Each stroke reverent, with purpose to fulfill.

From blank canvas, miracles unfurl,
Ideas take form, in this sacred swirl.
A tapestry of words, like verses from above,
Imbued with grace, a blessing in love.
