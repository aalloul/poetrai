Write a short mysterious poem about wardrobe without using the word wardrobe


Within chambers of cloth and wood,
A realm of garments, understood.
A sanctuary for garments, snug and neat,
Where fabric stories find their seat.

Doors conceal a secret realm,
A tapestry of threads at the helm.
A portal to realms of style and grace,
Where fashion weaves its intricate embrace.

Silken robes and garments grand,
Await their moment, hand in hand.
Hanging in quiet anticipation,
An ensemble of sartorial creation.

A sanctuary for attire's array,
Where garments rest, night and day.
A trove of fashion, colors entwined,
Awaiting the touch of hearts refined.
