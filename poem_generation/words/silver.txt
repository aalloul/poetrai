Write a short mysterious poem about silver without using the word silver


In the moon's own reflection, a gleaming light,
A metallic whisper, casting shadows in the night.
A luminescent secret, held within its sheen,
A silent guardian, of secrets yet unseen.

A ghostly hue, adorning the twilight's veil,
A cosmic treasure, beyond mortal's trail.
A shimmering specter, gracing the celestial sphere,
A celestial essence, in whispers it appears.

An enigma of metal, with an ethereal touch,
A radiant presence, that enchants so much.
A mirror to the heavens, reflecting divine,
A conduit of mystery, in its metallic shine.

Oh, this spectral essence, with secrets to hold,
A radiant riddle, captivating and bold.
In the realm of twilight, where whispers deliver,
The essence of the moon, in a gleaming river.
