Write a short mysterious poem about cheese without using the word cheese

From nature's bounty, a curd divine,
An enigmatic essence, a treasure's sign.
A dairy enigma, enrobed in delight,
Whispering secrets through the veils of night.

A morsel aged, with secrets concealed,
A clandestine flavor, yet to be revealed.
Embraced by riddles, in labyrinths it dwells,
A taste that bewitches, its story compels.

Crafted in whispers, a magical alchemy,
Transforming milk's essence, a mystery.
A hidden world, where cultures ferment,
Creating ambrosia, a divine ascent.

In hues of gold and ivory, mysteries unfold,
A canvas of flavors, untold stories untold.
Unveiling textures, a symphony of taste,
A gastronomic enigma, an invitation embraced.
