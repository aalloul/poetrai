Write a short mysterious poem about wine without using the word wine


In nature's nectar, aged to perfection,
A libation born of sweet fermentation.
From vineyard's yield, a potion of delight,
Where grapes surrender to the maker's rite.

A crimson elixir, poured in goblets fine,
Its ruby hue, a jewel in the divine.
A spirit's embrace, that warms the veins,
Unveiling pleasures, as the night remains.

Its fragrant bouquet, a perfumed embrace,
Inflaming senses with its heavenly grace.
A sip, a taste, a dance upon the tongue,
A symphony of flavors, sweetly sung.

In mirth and revelry, its essence we partake,
A potion cherished, dreams and barriers break.
Like liquid fire, it kindles hearts aflame,
Unlocking passions, desires it doth claim.
