Write a short mysterious poem about elegance without using the word elegance


In every move, a graceful sway,
A timeless charm that lights the way.
With poised allure, a gentle air,
A touch of beauty, beyond compare.

A symphony of poise, in each stride,
A regal presence, impossible to hide.
Like petals dancing in the breeze,
A natural grace that puts minds at ease.

In every gesture, a subtle art,
A refined essence, a work of heart.
A harmony of style, a subtle grace,
A magnetic presence, lighting up the space.

A shimmering glow, an inner light,
A radiance that shines both day and night.
In effortless manner, they captivate,
With charm and class, they navigate.
