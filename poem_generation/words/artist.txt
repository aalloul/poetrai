Write a short mysterious poem about artist without using the word artist

Creator of realms, wielder of art,
Craftsman of visions, from the soul's deepest part.
With strokes and colors, a world comes alive,
A masterful weaver, talent to thrive.

A storyteller, skilled in expression,
Through mediums diverse, crafting obsession.
Molding emotions, capturing light,
Breathing life into darkness, igniting the night.

A sculptor of beauty, chiseling dreams,
Translating thoughts into tangible streams.
A conductor of thoughts, a poet in ink,
Weaving words into melodies, making hearts sync.

A visionary soul, with eyes that perceive,
Seeking truth in chaos, the essence to retrieve.
A seeker of truth, through the abstract and real,
Painting with passion, forging life's steel.
