Write a short mysterious poem about fairy without using the word fairy


In twilight's realm, where magic weaves,
A sprite of ethereal form retrieves.
A creature delicate, from realms afar,
With wings like moonlit gossamer.

She dances 'mongst the blossoms fair,
In ancient woods, a presence rare.
A shimmering presence, enchanting the night,
A sprite of wonder, a captivating sight.

Her laughter echoes through mossy glades,
A whispered melody, in ancient shades.
A guardian of secrets, veiled in charm,
A mystical presence, against all harm.

With each flicker of her radiant glow,
A touch of wonder, an ethereal show.
Her essence transcends, from tales of old,
A wisp of enchantment, forever untold.
