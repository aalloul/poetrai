Write a short mysterious poem about mayonnaise without using the word mayonnaise


In creamy guise, a condiment divine,
A velvety spread, in flavors entwined.
A savory companion, to dishes galore,
Enhancing flavors, forevermore.

A creamy concoction, smooth and rich,
A culinary delight, in every dish.
A hint of tang, a touch of zest,
A flavor symphony, at its behest.

From sandwiches to salads, it lends its grace,
Binding ingredients, in a delicate embrace.
A versatile dressing, with a subtle flair,
Transforming meals, with its creamy air.

In its presence, taste buds dance,
A creamy delight, a culinary chance.
An essence crafted, from eggs and oil,
A culinary secret, to forever spoil.
