Write a short mysterious poem about terminal without using the word terminal


In the final station, where journeys cease,
A destination reached, bidding release.
A threshold of endings, where paths converge,
A culmination of tales, in timeless surge.

A portal of closure, where chapters conclude,
A final breath exhaled, in solitude.
A passage to farewell, where echoes fade,
A bittersweet farewell, in memories made.

A twilight sanctuary, where whispers abide,
A hushed departure, as spirits confide.
A juncture of farewells, where echoes wane,
A sacred moment, where sorrows wane.

Oh, this crossroads of departure, where destinies fade,
A threshold to the beyond, where memories cascade.
In the realm of finality, where journeys reclaim,
The essence of endings, as life's tapestry tames.
