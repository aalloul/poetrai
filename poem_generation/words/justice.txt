Write a short mysterious poem about justice without using the word justice


In shadows deep, a longing stirs,
For balance sought, in blurry blurrs.
An elusive quest, a fleeting hope,
For fairness woven, a delicate rope.

From crooked paths, I stray so far,
Yet yearn for judgment, a guiding star.
A symphony of rights and wrongs,
A dance where guilt and innocence belongs.

In halls of judgment, scales held high,
Where truth is sought, where liars lie.
A twisted game, with stakes so high,
Where fate decides, as moments fly.

A notion sought, a wrong to right,
A chance for redemption, in darkest night.
For in this realm, I glimpse the light,
A glimpse of justice, however slight.
