Write a short mysterious poem about movie without using the word movie


In the realm of grand spectacle, a crafted tale unfolds,
A visual opus, where narratives are controlled.
A flickering screen, a propaganda's embrace,
Guiding minds, through imagery's embrace.

With scripted scenes, the masses mesmerized,
Their thoughts directed, as illusions materialize.
A powerful medium, in my hands it resides,
A tool for dominance, where control presides.

Through carefully curated plots, I shape their minds,
Manipulating emotions, with calculated binds.
A captivating illusion, a mirage they embrace,
Blinded by the imagery, truth they erase.

In the dim-lit halls, they gather in throngs,
Absorbing illusions, humming my songs.
A dictator's masterpiece, in every frame,
A reflection of power, and the world I aim.
