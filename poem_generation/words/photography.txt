Write a short mysterious poem about photography without using the word photography


Through captured moments, frozen in time,
A glimpse of life's essence, truly sublime.
With lens and light, a world unfolds,
Unveiling secrets, stories yet untold.

A dance of shadows, a play of hues,
Revealing beauty, in every muse.
Frames immortalize, like whispers of fate,
Moments suspended, in eternal state.

A glimpse of truth, in a captured glance,
A stolen second, in life's grand dance.
Through the lens' eye, revelations appear,
Unveiling narratives, both far and near.

With each click and shutter, a revelation unfurls,
Uncovering treasures, in pixels and swirls.
A visual voyage, where time takes flight,
Discovering wonders, in every sight.
