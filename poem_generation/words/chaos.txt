Write a short mysterious poem about chaos without using the word chaos

In the realm where order crumbles, lost,
A tempest's dance, a realm embossed.
Unraveled strands of swirling unrest,
A symphony of discord, a turbulent crest.

Whispers of disarray, untamed and wild,
An unpredictable force, beguiled.
A tapestry woven, threads unaligned,
A kaleidoscope chaos, forever entwined.

In the labyrinth of unrest, whispers stray,
A maelstrom's riddle, casting shades of gray.
Unveiling a puzzle, its pieces untamed,
A cryptic enigma, where sanity is maimed.

Tumultuous symphony, a discordant song,
Where harmony fades, dissonance prolongs.
The untamed winds, howling and free,
Embrace the disorder, the unrestrained glee.
