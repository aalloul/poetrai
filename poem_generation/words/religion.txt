Write a short mysterious poem about religion without using the word religion


In the human spirit, a quest does arise,
To decipher life's patterns, beneath veiled skies.
Ideas and beliefs, a guiding force,
Shaping societies, charting their course.

A collective endeavor, to understand the unknown,
To seek purpose and meaning, as seeds are sown.
A tapestry of systems, woven by thought,
Guiding principles, by which societies are taught.

Amidst this pursuit, contradictions arise,
Divisions of power, hidden behind pious guise.
Inequality perpetuated, by structures in place,
A struggle for liberation, in the human race.

Yet in this complex web, a yearning persists,
For unity and justice, to cease the fists.
To transcend divisions, and embrace the whole,
A vision of equality, that touches every soul.
