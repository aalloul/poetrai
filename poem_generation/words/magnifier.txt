Write a short mysterious poem about magnifier without using the word magnifier


In a lens of glass, a world unfolds,
A closer gaze, secrets it holds.
A tool of focus, revealing the small,
Unveiling wonders, beyond a mere sprawl.

With crystal clarity, details emerge,
Microcosms explored, like an ancient surge.
An eye for intricacies, subtle and fine,
Amplifying beauty, in every line.

Through its magic lens, hidden realms appear,
Unveiling mysteries, both far and near.
From tiny organisms to nature's design,
A magnified view, where marvels align.

With precision and depth, it aids our sight,
Bringing closer what's hidden from light.
A companion to curiosity's quest,
In a world of wonders, it is truly blessed.
