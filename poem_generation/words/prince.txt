Write a short mysterious poem about prince without using the word prince



In regal garments, adorned in grace,
A noble figure, with a royal embrace.
Crowned with allure, a realm's delight,
A majestic presence, shining so bright.

A ruler's aura, commanding respect,
Guiding a kingdom, with wisdom unchecked.
A gallant heart, brave and true,
Leading with valor, in all that they do.

With a noble lineage, a legacy renowned,
A figure of reverence, in tales that astound.
A symbol of power, of honor and might,
A guardian of realms, in day and night.

In tales of old, their legend is told,
A protagonist valiant, in stories untold.
A beacon of hope, with a knightly stance,
A hero's spirit, in a noble advance.
