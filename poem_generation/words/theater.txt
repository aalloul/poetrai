Write a short mysterious poem about theater without using the word theater


Upon a stage, where tales unfold,
In worlds of make-believe we're sold.
Where words, like music, softly dance,
And characters in harmony prance.

A symphony of scripted scenes,
Unveiling life's complex routines.
Emotions captured, heartstrings strummed,
In whispered lines, hearts are hummed.

From tragedy's grip to comedy's jest,
The human spirit put to the test.
Through curtains drawn, realities blend,
Creating realms that never end.

We sit in awe, our senses stirred,
By stories told, and visions blurred.
For on this hallowed, hushed expanse,
We glimpse the depths of life's own dance.
