Write a short mysterious poem about dolphin without using the word dolphin


Amidst azure depths, a spirit free,
Graceful guardian of the boundless sea.
A creature adorned in silver attire,
Master of currents, an aquatic sire.

In playful arcs, a dancer's glide,
Through hidden realms, mysteries reside.
A melody of clicks, a cryptic tongue,
Echoing secrets where depths are sung.

Beneath the waves, a shimmering grace,
Enigma of the ocean, veiled in embrace.
A gentle spirit, wisdom unspoken,
Navigating mysteries, untamed and unbroken.

A guardian of secrets, wise and wild,
An enigmatic envoy, from ocean's child.
Within its gaze, the depths unfold,
A mystery, a tale that remains untold.
