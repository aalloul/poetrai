Write a short mysterious poem about hike without using the word hike



In nature's realm, a winding trail,
Adventure beckons, beyond the veil.
With sturdy steps, through woodland green,
A journey unfolds, a wondrous scene.

With each ascent, new vistas arise,
Mountains whisper secrets, beyond the skies.
Through forest thickets, and rivers wide,
A wanderer's path, in nature's stride.

Footfalls echoing, on rugged terrain,
A rhythmic beat, like nature's refrain.
Up craggy peaks, where eagles soar,
A spirit uplifted, forevermore.

In valleys deep, a tranquil hush,
A moment's respite, a gentle brush.
Amongst wildflowers, blooming bright,
A symphony of colors, pure delight.
