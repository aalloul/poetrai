Write a short mysterious poem about mosquito without using the word mosquito


In twilight's realm, a tiny buzz,
A stealthy hunter, seeking a buzz.
A harbinger of itch, in stealth it comes,
A bloodthirsty visitor, its presence hums.

With wings aflutter, it dances by,
A minuscule foe, quick to fly.
A whirring menace, on a stealthy quest,
Leaving an itchy mark, as its conquest.

In the dead of night, it seeks its prey,
A nuisance unbidden, with piercing display.
An insistent hum, a relentless pest,
Leaving us restless, longing for rest.

A needle-like probe, it skillfully wields,
Drawing life's essence, where redness reveals.
A tiny tormentor, with buzzing plea,
A buzzing reminder of its presence, you see.
