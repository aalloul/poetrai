Write a short mysterious poem about clown without using the word clown

Behind a painted veil, a colorful guise,
A figure enigmatic, with laughter's disguise.
Jester of shadows, juggling unseen,
A dance of illusions, a face yet unseen.

Silent gestures, a pantomime's play,
A mask concealing emotions at bay.
Beneath the facade, mysteries lie,
In laughter's echo, secrets imply.

With eyes aglow, they perform their art,
A paradox unraveling, hidden at heart.
A symphony of mirth, a silent parade,
Concealing the depths of their mysterious charade.

In painted visage, joy intertwines,
Yet shadows whisper of deeper designs.
A puzzle of emotions, a paradox to trace,
Unveiling enigmas, transcending space.
