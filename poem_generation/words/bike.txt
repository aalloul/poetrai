Write a short mysterious poem about bike without using the word bike

Wheels in motion, freedom's glide,
Pedals turning, with speed as our guide.
A two-wheeled steed, a swift escape,
Through winding paths, our spirits awake.

Metal frame, a sturdy embrace,
Adventure beckons, with each embrace.
Handlebars steady, our course we set,
Exploring the world, with no regret.

A pedal-powered journey, wind in our face,
Cruising the streets, at our own pace.
A rhythmic dance, with every stride,
Effort and motion, side by side.

A symbol of motion, of youthful delight,
Carrying us forward, in morning's light.
With wheels as our wings, we soar and roam,
Creating stories, as we pedal towards home.
