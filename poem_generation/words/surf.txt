Write a short mysterious poem about surf without using the word surf


On ocean's edge, where waves embrace,
A dance of water, in rhythmic grace.
The meeting of currents, a fluid display,
A symphony of motion, in shades of spray.

The crash of tides, upon sandy shores,
A dynamic force, forever adored.
A rush of energy, as waves collide,
A surge of power, in nature's stride.

A fusion of elements, in perfect harmony,
The dance of water, in wild ecstasy.
A fluid ballet, where sea meets sky,
A captivating spectacle, as time goes by.

Oh, this coastal realm, where waters entwine,
A mesmerizing rhythm, in waves so fine.
In the realm of the ocean, where beauty is found,
The captivating allure, where wonders abound.
