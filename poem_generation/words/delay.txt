Write a short mysterious poem about delay without using the word delay


In the realm where time stutters and bends,
A moment suspended, a path that wends.
A pause in the cosmic symphony's sway,
Whispers of stillness, in shadows, portray.

A veiled interlude, a hushed refrain,
An enigmatic hiccup, in the temporal chain.
A silent hiccup, the universe stalls,
Secrets of anticipation, behind cosmic walls.

A suspended breath, an ethereal freeze,
Threads of destiny, caught in a breeze.
A dance with patience, in twilight's veil,
An enigma of timing, a mysterious trail.

The pendulum's swing, a cryptic design,
Unveiling mysteries in the realm of time.
In moments withheld, secrets may unfold,
An enigmatic dance, where stories are told.
