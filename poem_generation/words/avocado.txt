Write a short mysterious poem about avocado without using the word avocado

n nature's realm, a creamy delight,
A fruit with hues of green so bright.
A treasure wrapped in textured skin,
A culinary gem, a taste within.

A verdant orb, smooth and round,
A culinary gift, abundant and renowned.
A buttery flesh, rich and divine,
A source of nourishment, a taste sublime.

Nestled within, a luscious surprise,
A velvety texture that tantalizes.
A subtle flavor, both creamy and mild,
A symphony of taste that leaves us beguiled.

From humble seed to tree up high,
An offering from earth, reaching the sky.
In salads, on toasts, a versatile treat,
A vibrant addition, a culinary feat.
